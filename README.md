# spm-infinite-pit

A mod I wanted to make back in the day but got sidetracked with other things, and now we have [Tartt's randomiser](https://github.com/shiken-yme/spm-pit-randomizer/) anyway.

Most stuff here isn't too useful or noteworthy, but I thought it'd be better to have it public anyway. The badge menu attempt is probably the most interesting part.
